# [ARCHIVED] Create an Angular app with Office 365 APIs

**Note:** This repo is archived and no longer actively maintained. Security vulnerabilities may exist in the project, or its dependencies. If you plan to reuse or run any code from this repo, be sure to perform appropriate security checks on the code or dependencies first. Do not use this project as the starting point of a production Office Add-in. Always start your production code by using the Office/SharePoint development workload in Visual Studio, or the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office), and follow security best practices as you develop the add-in.

This sample was built for [Create an Angular app with Office 365 APIs](http://aka.ms/get-started-with-js). You will complete the project in the *Starter* folder as you walk through the tutorial found on that page. You can find the completed project in the *Completed* folder of this repository.

Check out [Create an Angular app with Office 365 APIs](http://aka.ms/get-started-with-js) for a complete walkthrough on creating an Angular web application with the Office 365 APIs. If you'd prefer to just run the completed project found in the *Completed* folder, read the rest of this README. 

<a name="prerequisites"/>
## Prerequisites

This sample requires the following:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Node is required to run the sample on a development server and to install dependencies. 
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](http://aka.ms/ro9c62) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.
* A Microsoft Azure tenant to register your application. Azure Active Directory provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](http://aka.ms/jjm0q7).

**Note**  You will also need to ensure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. Check out the Active Directory team's blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://aka.ms/lrb3ln) for instructions. In this post, the *Adding a new directory* section will explain how to do this. You can also read [Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps](http://aka.ms/fv273q) for more information.

## Register and configure the app

1. Sign into the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) using your Office 365 business account credentials.

2. Click the **Active Directory** node in the left column and select the directory linked to your Office 365 subscription.

3. Select the **Applications** tab and then **Add** at the bottom of the screen.

4. On the pop-up, select **Add an application my organization is developing**. Then click the arrow to continue. 

5. Choose a name for the app, such as *SimpleMailApp*, and select **Web application and/or web API** as its Type. Then click the arrow to continue.

6. The value of **Sign-on URL** is the URL where the application will be hosted. Use *http://127.0.0.1:8080/* for the sample project.

7. The value of **App ID URI** is a unique identifier for Azure AD to identify the app. You can use http://{your_subdomain}/SimpleMailApp, where {your_subdomain} is the subdomain of .onmicrosoft you specified while signing up for your Office 365 business account. Then click the check mark to provision the application.

8. Once the application has been successfully added, you will be taken to the Quick Start page for the application. From here, select the **Configure** tab.

9. Scroll down to the **permissions to other applications** section and click the **Add application** button.

10. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to get a user's email so add the **Office 365 Exchange Online** application. Click the plus sign in the application's row and then click the check mark at the top right to add it. Then click the check mark at the bottom right to continue.

11. In the **Office 365 Exchange Online** row, select **Delegated Permissions**, and in the selection list, choose **Read user mail**.

12. Click **Save** to save the app's configuration.

### Configure the app to allow the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow

In order to get an access token for Office 365 API requests, the application will use the OAuth implicit grant flow. You need to update the application's manifest to allow the OAuth implicit grant flow because it is not allowed by default. 

1. Select the **Configure** tab of the application's entry in the Azure Management Portal. 

2. Using the **Manage Manifest** button in the drawer, download the manifest file for the application and save it to the computer.

3. Open the manifest file with a text editor. Search for the *oauth2AllowImplicitFlow* property. By default it is set to *false*; change it to *true* and save the file.

4. Using the **Manage Manifest** button, upload the updated manifest file.

**Note** ADAL JS does not validate the token received from Azure AD. It relies on the app’s backend to do so, and until we call the backend, we don’t know if the user obtained an acceptable token. Business applications should have a server-side component for user authentication built into the web application for security reasons. Without this backend token validation, your app is susceptible to security attacks such as the [confused deputy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem).

## Run the app

Open **app.js** in *Completed/public/scripts* and replace *{your_subdomain}* with the subdomain of .onmicrosoft you specified for your Office 365 tenant and the client ID of your registered Azure application on lines 34 and 35, respectively. 

Next, install the necessary dependencies and run the project via the command line. Begin by opening a command prompt and navigating to the *Completed* folder. Once there, follow the steps below.

1. Install project dependencies by running ```npm install```.
2. Now that all the project dependencies have been installed, start the development server by running ```node server.js``` in the *Completed* folder.
3. Navigate to ```http://127.0.0.1:8080/``` in your web browser.
